		  	<h2>About</h2>
				<p>With the initiative to better onboard new employees by leading them down a "Guided" path, there needed to be a way to visually setup one or many paths of learning a user could travel on both the admin and end user view. Came up with naming the UX "Guided Learning"</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		  <h2>Problem</h2>
		  <p>I was tasked with coming up with how a Admin user would create a guided learning path. This flow, (which will be visible on the front end v2), would be a defined list populated with topics and tasks a user needs to complete in order to fulfill job requirements. Like a tech tree, topics and tasks can be gated and locked until other items have been passed or graduated.</p>

			<h2>Constraints</h2>
			<div>
			<p>With only a few EA (Early Adoptors) customers, I was asked to not design any net new UI. We decided to enhance and retrofit the current UI with this "guided learning" MVP. This way we could get it out quicker to our EA customers to test with their employee base.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Scope Creep</h2>
			<div>
			<p>I was also tasked with where and how a task item is created. This was a product requirement from customers. Thankfully, a new <a href="#">Content UI</a> was just completed :)</p>

		<div><h2>High-Level Goals</h2></div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Find a place admins can create tasks for their guided learning programs</li>
				<li>Enhance the current program UI with the guided learning MVP UX</li>
				<li>Design an easy way an admin can add, delete, move and link topics and tasks together easily in a way that makes sense</li>
				<li>Don’t bulk up the current UI, keep it as streamlined as possible</li>
				<li>Add task topics to the flow, as well as task creation</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div><h2>Research</h2></div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Go through customer provided tasks and evaluation paperwork to better understand what type of things a variety of new and exisiting employees would need to get up to speed on</li>
				<li>Sit in on Product Manager lead customer interviews and help define needs, best practices and requirements.</li>
				<li>Discuss system limitations and edge cases with server and client developers that need to be designed for to correctly mesh MVP into existing UI.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p class="spacer"><strong>For task creation:</strong> This was a no brainer. Put it in our brand new contentUI. It was designed to be scalable, so adding task in as another content type worked out great. In fact, most of the functionality was already built in other components.</p>

<div class="grid-container spacer">
		<div>
			<p><strong>For “Guided Learning” creation:</strong><i>This was a tough one.</i> After some ideation I came up with a floating toolbar idea that would only appear on hover. The idea is that an admin really does not need to see UI controls until he/she needs to manipulate a specific item. By hiding the controls, I was able to really keep the existing UI clean. In fact, I was able to hide some existing items slimming it down even more.</p>
			<p>When you are just looking at the program, it gives you a clear view of how the training for that selected group is going to look like. This was also something that we never had before.</p>

			<h2>Key Experiences</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Seamless task creation integration into contentUI</li>
				<li>A (pretty) clean retrofit to the existing program creation UI</li>
				<li>An innovative hidden toolbar with key actions to manipulate topics and tasks.</li>
				<li>Ability to drag n' drop for re-ordering and moving</li>
