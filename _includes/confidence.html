			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<div>
			<p>To better track user topic knowledge, there was a need to add confidence based answering to the microlearning experience. By asking how confident the user is on the answer, the system could better track knowledge retention vs knowledge decay . As one of the core UX flows of the platform the solution could not add any more time to the end user experience.</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>After some rounds of testing, showing confidence choices when you select your answer was by far the clear winner. Showing confidence on question answering did not add any extra time or clicks to the UX. Only by selecting your confidence level could you advance to the next question. If answered incorrectly, you would see the correct answer and then be able to move on.</p>
