	  	<h2>About</h2>
			<p>The Axonify content management system is one of the core features of the platform. Users come here to create and manage all the microlearning content they want to serve their employees. Content can include different question types (multiple choice, multi-answer, matching, fill in the blank), SCORM modules, Video training, Surveys and Key performance indicators.</p>

		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The old iteration of content  was showing its age as it was a very click intensive bulky UX. The old iteration was also not supporting industry training design best practices around strategic planning, key learning points, change audits and reviewing.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Constraints</h2>
			<p>Had to respect the current content hierarchy: Category > Subject > Topic
			Still needed to support a “click to edit and click to save” paradigm. Autosave was to large of a change from a server development point of view, especially for a v1.</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>For the new content UI I opted for a 2 panel “live” view. Essentially each level would have details view with the ability to drill into a sub-view of that category. All editing and creation would be done in these views as well.</p>
